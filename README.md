How to install the submod:

  Once you have the Zip file added, make sure to extract all of the file into your "Submods" folder in your MAS (Monika After Story) DDLC directory!

How do I update the submod?
  Make sure you install the Submod updater plugin here; https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin
  If you have that installed, the submod will automatically tell you when there is an update, and will install it directly!

Have fun learning and talking to your Monika!
And of course, I hope you learn some things too!


Future plans:
More Month Awareness events
Revamping checkups
Improving general code base
Adding minigames to the submod to help make learning easier and more engaging
And more!
